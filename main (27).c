/*
A two-dimensional array is an array of arrays and can be thought of as a table. You can also think of a two-dimensional array as a grid for representing a chess board, city blocks, and much more.

A two-dimensional array declaration indicates the number of number rows and the number of columns.

An array can have more than two dimensions. For example, a[5][3][4] is an array that has 5 elements that each store 3 elements that each store 4 elements.
